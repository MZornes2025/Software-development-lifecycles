# Software Development Lifecycles Portfolio

## Overview  
This repo explores different software development lifecycles (SDLC) and Agile practices through examples and reflections. Goals: understand how to translate user needs, use user stories, adopt iterative delivery, and improve team collaboration.

## Technologies & Artifacts  
- SDLC / Agile methodology documentation  
- User story creation, sprint planning, retrospectives  
- Tools: Word / Google Docs, whatever interface used for documentation  
- Examples drawn from class projects (e.g. “SNHU Travel” project)

## My Contributions & Highlights  
- Created and refined **user stories** based on stakeholder/user feedback for real-classroom scenarios  
- Planned sprints with objectives, tracked tasks, and participated in daily stand-ups to improve communication  
- Conducted sprint reviews & retrospectives to identify bottlenecks and adjust processes  
- Emphasized continuous improvement, adaptability, and stakeholder alignment in project planning  

## What Recruiters Should Notice  
- Strong ability to understand requirements from a user perspective and convert them to actionable development tasks  
- Familiar with Agile / iterative development, not just theoretical, but how to apply process to keep teams aligned and projects on track  
- Communication & collaboration skills demonstrated via documentation and retrospectives  
- Mindset for quality: thinking ahead to testing, changes, and stakeholder satisfaction rather than just coding features  

## How to Explore This Repo  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the `README.md` in this repo to see class reflection content.  
3. Review documents like `Sprint Review and Retrospective` for process details.  
4. Look for examples of how user stories were written and how feedback loops adjusted designs.

## Optional Notes  
- Course project; all process artifacts here (user stories, sprint plans, etc.) were drafted by me.  
- If needed, I can provide sample diagrams or snapshots of Agile boards used (screenshots or exported views).
